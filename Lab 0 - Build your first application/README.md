## Need to know

**Runtime**: Set of resources that is used to run an application. Every programming language specifies an execution model, that is why there is Python, PHP, Go, Ruby, Java and many other runtimes. 

**Node.js**: Open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.

**Cloud Foundry**: Open source, multi-cloud application platform as a service (PaaS) governed by the Cloud Foundry Foundation. Cloud Foundry’s container-based architecture runs apps in any programming language over a variety of cloud service providers.

## Create your first app

1. Log-in to IBM Cloud
- https://cloud.ibm.com/login

2. Click the _**Create Resource**_ button at the top right. This action will take you to the 'Catalog'.

5. Let's configure our application!
- Choose _**London**_ or _**Frankfurt**_ as the region to deploy your application. 
- Select SDK Node.js runtime and the Lite (Free) plan with 256MB of memory.

## Summary

Fantastic! Lab 0 is complete! :smile:

In this lab you created your first Node.js application on IBM Cloud using Cloud Foundry public environment.
Now that your application is ready go to [Lab 1 - Enable Delivery Pipeline](https://github.com/sandra-calvo/cloud-rock-star/tree/master/Lab%201%20-%20Enable%20Delivery%20Pipeline).
